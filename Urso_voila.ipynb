    "As you now know, you need a GPU to train nearly any useful deep learning model. So, do you need a GPU to use that model in production? No! You almost certainly *do not need a GPU to serve your model in production*. There are a few reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we've seen, GPUs are only useful when they do lots of identical work in parallel. If you're doing (say) image classification, then you'll normally be classifying just one user's image at a time, and there isn't normally enough work to do in a single image to keep a GPU busy for long enough for it to be very efficient. So, a CPU will often be more cost-effective.\n",
    "- An alternative could be to wait for a few users to submit their images, and then batch them up and process them all at once on a GPU. But then you're asking your users to wait, rather than getting answers straight away! And you need a high-volume site for this to be workable. If you do need this functionality, you can use a tool such as Microsoft's [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime), or [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\n",
    "- The complexities of dealing with GPU inference are significant. In particular, the GPU's memory will need careful manual management, and you'll need a careful queueing system to ensure you only process one batch at a time.\n",
    "- There's a lot more market competition in CPU than GPU servers, as a result of which there are much cheaper options available for CPU servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the complexity of GPU serving, many systems have sprung up to try to automate this. However, managing and running these systems is also complex, and generally requires compiling your model into a different form that's specialized for that system. It's typically preferable to avoid dealing with this complexity until/unless your app gets popular enough that it makes clear financial sense for you to do so."
